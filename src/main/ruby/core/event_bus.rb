module Vertx

  # This class represents a distributed lightweight event bus which can encompass multiple vert.x instances.
  # It is very useful for otherwise isolated vert.x application instances to communicate with each other.
  #
  # Messages sent over the event bus are json objects represented as Ruby Hash instances.
  #
  # The event bus implements a distributed publish / subscribe network.
  #
  # Messages are sent to an address.
  #
  # There can be multiple handlers registered against that address.
  # Any handlers with a matching name will receive the message irrespective of what vert.x application instance and
  # what vert.x instance they are located in.
  #
  # All messages sent over the bus are transient. On event of failure of all or part of the event bus messages
  # may be lost. Applications should be coded to cope with lost messages, e.g. by resending them, and making application
  # services idempotent.
  #
  # The order of messages received by any specific handler from a specific sender will match the order of messages
  # sent from that sender.
  #
  # When sending a message, a reply handler can be provided. If so, it will be called when the reply from the receiver
  # has been received.
  #
  # When receiving a message in a handler the received object is an instance of EventBus::Message - this contains
  # the actual Hash of the message plus a reply method which can be used to reply to it.
