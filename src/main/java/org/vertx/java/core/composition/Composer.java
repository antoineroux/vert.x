/**
 * <p>Composer allows asynchronous control flows to be defined</p>
 *
 * <p>This is useful when you have some asynchronous actions to be performed <i>after</i> other actions have completed.
 * In a asynchronous framework such as vert.x you cannot just block on the result of one action before executing
 * the next one, since an event loop thread must never block. By using Composer you can describe the execution order
 * of a sequence of actions in a quasi-direct way, even though when they execute it will all be asynchronous.</p>
 * <p>Each action to execute is represented by an instance of {@link org.vertx.java.core.impl.Deferred}. A Deferred represents an action
 * which is yet to be executed. Instances of Deferred can represent any asynchronous action, e.g. copying a file from A to B,
 * or getting a key from a Redis server.</p>
 * <p>An example of using this class is as follows:</p>
 * <pre>
 *
 * // d1..dn are instances of Deferred, returned from other vert.x modules, e.g. {@link org.vertx.java.core.file.FileSystem}
 *
 * Composer comp = new Composer();
 * comp.parallel(d1);
 * comp.parallel(d2);
 * comp.parellel(d3);
 * comp.series(d4);
 * comp.parallel(d5);
 * comp.series(d6);
 * comp.series(d7);
 * comp.parallel(d8);
 * comp.parallel(d9);
 * comp.execute();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In the above example, when {@code execute} is invoked, d1, d2, and d3 will be executed. When d1, d2, and d3
 * have all completed, then d4 and d5 will be executed. When d4 and d5 have completed d6 will be executed.
 * When d6 has completed d7, d8 and d9 will be executed. All this will occur asynchronous with no thread blocking for
 * anything to complete.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is another example which uses the return values from actions in subsequent actions:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Composer comp = new Composer();
 * final Future&lt;Integer&gt; f = comp.parallel(d1)
 * comp.series(new SimpleAction() {
 *   public void act() {
 *     System.out.println("Result of d1 is " + f.result);
 *   }
 * }
 * comp.execute();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In the above example, when execute is invoked d1 will be executed. When d1 completes the result of the action
 * will be available in the {@link Future} f, and the second action will be executed which simply displays the result.</p>
