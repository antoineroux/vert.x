/**
 * <p>This class represents a distributed lightweight event bus which can encompass multiple vert.x instances.
 * Verticles can communicate via message passing by using the event bus.
 * The event bus implements a distributed publish / subscribe network.</p>
 *
 * <p>Messages sent over the event bus are represented by instances of the  {@link Message} class.
 * Subclasses of Message exist for messages that represent all primitive types as well as java.lang.String,
 * {@link Buffer}, byte[] and {@link JsonObject}</p>
 *
 * <p>Messages are sent to an address which is simply an arbitrary String.
 * There can be multiple handlers registered against that address.
 * Any handlers with a matching name will receive the message irrespective of what vert.x application instance and
 * what vert.x instance they are located in.</p>
 *
 * <p>All messages sent over the bus are transient. On event of failure of all or part of the event bus messages
 * may be lost. Applications should be coded to cope with lost messages, e.g. by resending them, and making application
 * services idempotent.</p>
 *
 * <p>The order of messages received by any specific handler from a specific sender should match the order of messages
 * sent from that sender.</p>
 *
 * <p>When sending a message, a reply handler can be provided. If so, it will be called when the reply from the receiver
 * has been received. Reply messages can also be replied to, etc, ad infinitum</p>
