# This somewhat elaborate example shows an interaction including HTTP, STOMP, AMQP and Redis
#
# Summary: We have a website which allows the user to check the price and stock count for inventory items.
#
# It contains the following components (In real life these would probably be running on different nodes).
#
# 1) HTTP server. We create an HTTP server which serves the index.html page from disk, and responds to HTTP requests for an item.
# when it receives a request it uses the request-response pattern to send that request in an AMQP message to a queue
# and sets a handler for the response.
# When the response returns it formats the price and stock count in the html page returned to the browser.
#
# 2) AMQP consumer. We create an AMQP consumer that consumes from the AMQP queue, and then does two things in parallel
# a) Call redis to get the price for the item
# b) Send a STOMP message, using the request-response pattern to a STOMP destination to request the stock count
# When both a) and b) asynchronously complete, we return an AMQP message as the response to the HTTP server that made
# the request
#
# 3) A redis server
#
# 4) A STOMP server
#
# 5) STOMP consumer. We create a STOMP consumer that subscribes to the STOMP destination, calculates a stock count and
# sends that back in a response message
